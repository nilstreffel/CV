- While working for small employers I learned to work physically, I took part in the construction of a barn, a swimming pool, repainting a villa. This experience made me realise how difficult physical work is and how important it is to succeed in my projects. **2018 - 2019**

#### Interests and achievements

- As a Scout for more than 12 years, I was able to organise and experience a month-long `solidarity project` in Laos to give French and English lessons to young blind or visually impaired Laotians.
